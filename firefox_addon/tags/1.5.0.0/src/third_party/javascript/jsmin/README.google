Description:
JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace
from JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half,
resulting in faster downloads. It also encourages a more expressive
programming style because it eliminates the download cost of clean,
literate self-documentation.

Local Modifications:

1. Wrapped jsmin() in a namespace JSMIN, and renamed to compile(), so
   it's now invoked by calling JSMIN.compile().

2. Changed String.prototype.has() to a local function JSMIN.stringHas,
   since we don't want to add new methods to the global String object.

3. Removed variable ret, which wasn't locally scoped, and instead
   leaked onto the global object (bad).

4. Removed setting of jsmin.oldSize and jsmin.newSize.

5. Various fixes to make jsmin.js match jsmin.c. This makes jsmin.js
   behave differently than the original jsmin.js from fmarcia.info,
   but makes jsmin.js behave exactly like jsmin.c, which is what we
   want. This was necessary because the original jsmin.js failed to
   properly process several different JavaScript files found on the
   web.

6. Changed API to no longer accept a level and/or comment, since this
   functionality is not part of the original jsmin.c

7. Removed unused 'input' parameter passed to function m().
