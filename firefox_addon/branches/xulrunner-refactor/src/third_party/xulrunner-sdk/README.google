Description:
xulrunner sdk components that are needed in order to build the page-speed
extension using gyp.

Local Modifications:
Merged distributions for multiple platforms in a single tree and excluded
many files that are currently not needed in order to build the page-speed
extension.

Forward-declared several classes and one typedef in
jsdIDebuggerService.h in order to minimize dependencies on the rest of
the xulrunner sdk.

The version of the SDK for Linux x64 was built by hand on Ubuntu 6.10
from the Firefox 3.6 source, using the following mozconfig
file:

mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=xulrunner
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-xulrunner
ac_add_options --enable-application=xulrunner
ac_add_options --disable-javaxpcom
ac_add_options --disable-dbus
ac_add_options --disable-libnotify
ac_add_options --disable-necko-wifi
