Description:
Various Firefox source files.

jsdIDebuggerService_3_0.idl comes from FF 3.0.11 source. Note that
jsdIDebuggerService.idl *did* change some time between FF3.0 and
FF3.0.11, but the uuid did *not* change. Fortunately, the subset of
the jsdIDebuggerService API that we do depend on did not move in the
vtable, so this is not currently a problem. If we take on additional
jsdIDebuggerService API dependencies we should verify that they are
compatible across all 3.0.x versions.

jsdIDebuggerService_3_5.idl comes from the FF 3.5 source.

Local Modifications:
Renamed idl files to include the Firefox version number they are
associated with. This allows us to support versions of the same IDL
file.

Changes to jsdIDebuggerService_*.idl:
1. Renamed all interfaces to include the Firefox version number. For
   instance, jsdIScript becomes jsdIScript_3_0.
2. Commented out includes of jsdebug.h and nsAString.h, and
   substituted the forward declared classes that
   jsdIDebuggerService_*.h depends on.
