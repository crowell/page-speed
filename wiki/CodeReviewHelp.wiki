#summary Help for Page Speed code reviews at http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com.

Page Speed uses [http://code.google.com/p/rietveld Rietveld] for code reviews. You may want to read the Rietveld [http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewHelp code review help] first, then return to this wiki.

The Page Speed code review server is http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com.

To submit a code review, we recommend using [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/static/upload.py upload.py], which requires python 2.5. If you do not have python 2.5 on your system, you can still submit a code review through the [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/new web interface].

You will need to specify the destination code review server, as well as CC page-speed-codereview@googlegroups.com like so:

`upload.py -s page-speed-codereview.appspot.com -cc page-speed-codereview@googlegroups.com`

After uploading your code review, you can verify that it was submitted for review at the [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/all recent issues] page.
