#summary Help for Page Speed code reviews at http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com.

Page Speed uses [http://code.google.com/p/rietveld Rietveld] to manage code reviews. You may want to read the Rietveld [http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/wiki/CodeReviewHelp code review help] first, then return to this wiki.

Page Speed code reviews are managed at http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com.

To submit a code review, we recommend using [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/static/upload.py upload.py], which requires python 2.5. If you do not have python 2.5 on your system, you can still submit a code review through the [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/new web interface].

If you use the default version of upload.py available from codereview.appspot.com, you will need to specify the `-s` command line option to indicate that the code review should be uploaded to the Page Speed code review server (as opposed to the Rietveld code review server), like so

`upload.py -s page-speed-codereview.appspot.com`

After uploading your code review, you can verify that it was submitted for review at the [http://page-speed-codereview.appspot.com/all recent issues] page.
